News Type Classification

Overview

This project is an NLP-based machine learning model that classifies news articles into different categories. Using natural language processing techniques, it preprocesses text data, extracts features, and applies classification algorithms to predict the type of news article.

Features

Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)

TF-IDF vectorization

Classification using machine learning models

Model evaluation and accuracy analysis

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

NLTK

TensorFlow/PyTorch (if applicable)

Dataset

The dataset contains news articles labeled by category. Ensure the dataset is placed in the data/ directory before running scripts.
